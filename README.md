Famo.us and Backbone demo app in flashcard format to practice some French verb conjugations

This app is based on some of the sample code in Famo.us University. For me it was a good use case to try to merge backbone.js 
as the M-C part of an MVC framework with the V (view) building of Famo.us.

Feel free to dig into it and let me know what you think! It could easily be expanded to include more business logic; currently I 
only show regular vs. irregular verbs via color changes in the initial data grid, but all kinds of fun with French verbs could happen here.

This is what happens when former French teachers become developers :)
